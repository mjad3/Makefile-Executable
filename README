This program reads info from a makefile (can be specified with -f) and executes specified commands in order.
We parse the makefile (in parser.c) into a node structure that we use to traverse targets and execute them in correct order.
representation.c specifies the nodes structure and creates nodes.
build_specs.c connects and traverses the nodes to find the correct build order.
create_exec.c executes commands.

Thanks for grading!
